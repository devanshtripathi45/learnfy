  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "bash start.sh",
    "healthcheckPath": "/health/",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 300,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

### `start.sh` (New)
```bash
#!/bin/bash

- In Railway dashboard, click "New" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
- Railway will automatically set `DATABASE_URL`

### 3. **Deploy:**
- Push your code to GitHub
- Railway will automatically detect the configuration
- Your app will be live at `https://your-app-name.railway.app`
