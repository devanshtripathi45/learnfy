# 🔧 Local Development HTTPS Error - SOLVED!

## ✅ **Problem Fixed:**
The Django development server was receiving HTTPS requests but only supports HTTP, causing the errors you saw in the terminal.

## 🚀 **Solution Applied:**

### 1. **Updated Settings.py**
- ✅ **Disabled all HTTPS-only settings** for local development
- ✅ **Set `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']`** for local testing
- ✅ **Added explicit HTTP-only configuration**

### 2. **Server Configuration**
- ✅ **Server now runs on `127.0.0.1:8000`** (explicit HTTP)
- ✅ **No more HTTPS redirects** in development
- ✅ **Proper security settings** for local vs production

## 🎯 **How to Access Your Site:**

### **✅ CORRECT URLs (Use These):**
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
http://localhost:8000
```

### **❌ WRONG URLs (Don't Use These):**
```
https://127.0.0.1:8000  ← This causes the errors!
https://localhost:8000  ← This causes the errors!
```

## 🛠️ **If You Still See HTTPS Errors:**

### **Method 1: Clear Browser Cache**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Clear browsing data
3. Try accessing `http://127.0.0.1:8000` again

### **Method 2: Use Incognito/Private Mode**
1. Open incognito/private browsing
2. Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### **Method 3: Force HTTP in Browser**
1. Type `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (not `https://`)
2. If browser redirects to HTTPS, clear cache

### **Method 4: Use Different Browser**
- Try Chrome, Firefox, or Edge
- Sometimes one browser has cached HTTPS redirects
